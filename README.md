### Configuring the Project
1. In the Solution Explorer Right Click the "CodingChallenge.Presentation" and Click "Set as Startup Project"
2. Open "CodingChallenge.Presentation" and navigate to and open "appsettings.json".
3. On Line 3 change the existing "DefaultConnection" and paste the connection string you copied earlier. 
4. Due to no existing trusted CA Certificate registered, we're going to append "Encrypte=False;" to the end of the connection string instead since this will be running locally and not exposed. 
   - Your connection string should now look something like this: "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=master;Trusted_Connection=True;Encrypt=False;"
5. Save your changes and Build the solution by the following methods:
   - Visual Studio Hotkeys: Ctrl+Shift+B
   - Clicking the Build Menu option in the top of Visual Studio, then clicking "Build Solution"
